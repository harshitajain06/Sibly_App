# React Native App with Firebase and OpenAI Integration

This is a React Native project that utilizes Firebase for authentication and Firestore for database operations. It also integrates OpenAI's API via Axios for AI-based functionalities.

## Features

- **Authentication**: User login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for storing user data.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration using Axios.
- **UI Framework**: React Native Paper for styling and components.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Expo CLI for running the React Native app.
- Firebase project configured with your app.
- OpenAI API key.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
